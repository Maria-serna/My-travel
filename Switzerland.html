				<h1> <a name="history">HISTORY</a></h1>	
				<div id="history"> 
					<p> Until the mid-19th century, it was predominantly an agricultural community. The town was “discovered” mid-century by British mountaineers, most notably Edward Whymper, whose conquest of the Matterhorn made the village famous. The first triumphant ascent of the Matterhorn in 1865 was followed by a rush on the mountains surrounding the village. Praborno or Prato Borno are the older names of Zermatt; they appear in the ancient maps as early as the thirteenth century.</p>

							Zermatt in the past.
						</figcaption></figure></center>
						<p> The name of Zermatt, derives from the alpine meadows, or Matten (in German), in the valley. The name appeared first as Zur Matte “in the meadow” and became later Zermatt. The reason of this change from Praborno to Zermatt is attributed to the gradual replacement of the Romance-speaking people by German-speaking colonizers.</p><p> Zermatt and the Matterhorn form a unique pair in the world. The arrival of the railway to the town in the middle of the 19th century, the opening of the Gornergrat rack railway, which goes up to 3,089 metre and the inauguration of the first ski lifts in the middle of the 20th century facilitated the arrival of mountaineers, skiers and tourists to Zermatt. As the years went by, Zermatt expanded its skiing area, reaching the Theodul glacier, the Plateau Rosa and the summit of the Matterhorn glacier paradise, where the cable car, the ski lift and the highest ice cave in Europe are located. Zermatt is also home to the first underground funicular in Switzerland, the Sunnegga Espress, currently one of the fastest and most modern in the world. It was in Sunnegga that Zermatt's first ski lift was inaugurated during the 1940s.</p>
						<p>In 2015, Zermatt celebrates the 150th anniversary of the first ascent of the Matterhorn.</p>
