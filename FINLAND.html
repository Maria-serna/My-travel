<p>One of the most particular characteristics of Lapland is the natural phenomenon in which the sun is seen 24 hours a day in summer, or in whic the sun does not rise all day, and therefore, they live an "eternal" night and are able to observe the Northern Lights.</p></b></center>

<p>The name Lapland could mean "Northern Desert" or "Wild North". The word itself is derived from the ancient Swedish: Lapp or from the origins of Finnish: Lappalainen. Although the true origin and meaning of this word is an enigma since it is not known how the word Lapp appeared in the Nordic languages.</p>
<p>It’s widely believed that Lapland was first inhabited after the Scandinavian ice caps began to melt around 7000 years ago. The Sami people were among the first natives of the region and rock carvings from thousands of years ago. Like many parts of the world, wars and disputes have had massive impact on the land and its people.</p>
<p>The Sami are the only indigenous people in the European Union and reside in the northern regions of Finland, Norway and Sweden, as well as in parts of northeastern Russia. In Finland, the Sami population is approximately 6000 and the preservation of their language and culture, which is in danger of extinction, is governed by the autonomous parliament of Inari, Finland.</p>
