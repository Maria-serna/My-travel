<p>The first people to inhabit the island were the Arawak Indians. The name Aruba appears to have been derived from the Indian word Arawak oibubai, which means guide. In 1499, the Spanish explorer Alonso de Ojeda claimed the territory for the Spanish crown. Almost 200 years later, the Dutch captured the islands of Aruba, Curaçao and Bonaire from the Spanish.</p>
